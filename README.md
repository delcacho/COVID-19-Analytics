# COVID-19-Analytics
KPI Tracking of Coronavirus spread over time along with some forecasting models.

## Data Sources
Currently downloading country level data from Johns Jopkins CSSE, regional data for the
US from  USAFacts.org, and regional level data for Spain straight from the PDFs the
Health Ministry publishes daily at https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/situacionActual.htm.

## Currently tracked KPIs
- Case fatality rate over time (file deathrate.py)
- Confirmed cases over time in logarithmic representation (file logchart.py)
- Several ratios for hospitalization data for Spain (file spain/icu.py) including:
  - Case fatality rate per region
  - Share of total fatalities for a given region for all fatalities in Spain
  - ICU fill rate (with number of beds prior to the Covid-19 crisis, which is a surrogate for available ventilators)
  - ICU patients to confirmed cases ratio (as an indicator of severity)
  - Hospitalized patients to confirmed cases ratio (resolved cases still count as hospitalized if hospitalized once)
  - Confirmed cases per 1M population (Incidence) 
  - Confirmed cases per 1M population adjusted for hospitalization rates (Higher hospitalization rates, suggest higher actual cases) 
  - Adjusted incidence to ICU beds ratio (as per the adjusment in the previous line)
  - Suspected actual total cases (Adjustment for hospitalization rate under the idea that only 20% of patients warrant hospitalization)
- Newly confirmed cases over time for Madrid (file spain/madrid.py). This file can be used to chart any of the regional metrics for Spain outlined above.
- Some metrics for Italy:
  - Newly confirmed cases over time for Italy (file italy/italy.py)
  - Lombardy under lockdown newly confirmed cases (file italy/lombardy.py), from static data downloaded from here (http://lispa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/637ec3dc28ec4ea591cc5c724f127701)
  - Lombardy under lockdown growth rate (file italy/lombardy2.py)
- Analysis of confirmed cases by latitude:
  - Bar chart of confirmed cases (file latitude/latitude.py)  
  - Confirmed cases over time in lograithmic representation (file latitude/latitude2.py)  
  - Northern hemisphere vs Southern hemistpher confirmed cases over time in lograithmic representation (file latitude/hemisphere.py)  
- Forecasts with a polynomial model to try to fit a Bell curve for newly confirmed cases:
  - Forecasts for several countries (Spain, Italy, UK) along with expected crossing points (file curve/cross.py)
  - Simple polynomial model without correcting the right hand side of the Bell curve (file curve/curve.py).
  - Polynomial model with Bell curve reflection after finding maximum with Newton-Raphson method  (file curve/curvefixed.py).
  - Newly confirmed cases for polynomial model with Bell curve reflection (file curve/curvefixedbell.py).
- Analysis for newly confirmed cases vs newly confirmed deaths for Hubei (file china/hubei.py). This data seems to be manually altered to hide the severity of the epidemic.
